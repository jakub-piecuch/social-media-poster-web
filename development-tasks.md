# Social Media Poster - Development Tasks

## Task 1: Project Setup (COMPLETED)
- Create new Next.js application "social-media-poster"
- Set up MongoDB v7.0 Docker container
- Configure Docker environment
- Establish connection to MongoDB via MongoDB Compass
- Define application architecture and folder structure

## Task 2: Social Media User Upload Feature (COMPLETED)
- Create database schema for social media user profiles
- Develop API routes for user profile management (CRUD operations)
- Create service layer for handling user data
- Develop repository layer for database operations
- Add authentication and authorization for secure access
- Implement error handling and user feedback

## Task 3: Backend Error Handling and Logging Infrastructure (PAUSED)
- Create common ErrorDetails type for consistent error structure
- Implement standardized API error responses
- Add logging system for tracking API operations and errors
- Create middleware for global error catching and formatting (?)
- Implement database operation error handling
- Add request/response logging for debugging
- Create utility functions for error management
- Document error handling approach and error codes
- Implement centralized error logging mechanism

# Task 4: Facebook API Integration - Completion Review

## Completed Items ✅

### Research & Requirements
- ✅ Researched Facebook Graph API requirements and endpoints
- ✅ Identified required permission scopes for different operations
- ✅ Considered API rate limits and error handling

### OAuth Authentication System
- ✅ Implemented OAuth authentication flow for Facebook
- ✅ Created endpoint: `/api/auth/facebook/initiate` to generate authorization URL
- ✅ Created endpoint: `/api/auth/facebook/callback` to handle OAuth callback
- ✅ Implemented token refresh mechanism
- ✅ Designed secure token storage solution by extending SocialMediaUser model

### Data Models
- ✅ Extended SocialMediaUser model with FacebookAuthData interface
- ✅ Created appropriate MongoDB schemas and indexes
- ✅ Updated mapper to handle Facebook-specific data

### Facebook API Integration
- ✅ Created FacebookApiService for Graph API interactions
- ✅ Implemented exception handling with FacebookApiException
- ✅ Created FacebookAccountService for account management
- ✅ Added API endpoints for Facebook account management
- ✅ Implemented token validation and refresh logic

### Testing & Documentation
- ✅ Documented the Facebook API integration implementation
- ✅ Updated application documentation to reflect new features

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows the domain-driven design pattern established in the existing codebase:

1. **Model Layer**: Extended SocialMediaUser with Facebook auth data
2. **Repository Layer**: Enhanced to support Facebook-specific queries
3. **Service Layer**: Added dedicated Facebook services
4. **Controller Layer**: Implemented Facebook account management controllers
5. **API Routes**: Created routes for Facebook OAuth and account operations

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

Task 4 has been fully implemented according to the requirements. The system now supports:

1. Adding Facebook accounts via OAuth authentication
2. Storing and refreshing access tokens securely
3. Managing Facebook accounts (create, read, update, delete)
4. Interacting with the Facebook Graph API for various operations

## Next Steps (Task 5)

With the Facebook API integration complete, the next step is to implement the Bot Scheduling System according to the planned development tasks.

The scheduling system will build upon the Facebook API integration to:
- Schedule automated actions for Facebook accounts
- Manage job queues for pending operations
- Handle retries for failed operations
- Implement rate limiting to avoid API restrictions
- Create a monitoring and reporting system

## Future Tasks:
- Frontend development for user interface
- Social media post creation and scheduling
- Integration with social media platforms
- Analytics and reporting
- User management and multi-user support
- Post templates and saved drafts

## Technical Requirements:
- RESTful API design
- Backend validation
- Consistent error handling
- Authentication for secure operations
- Performance optimization
- Backend does all business logic 
- FrontEnd is just the view layer as much as it can
